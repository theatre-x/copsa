The C.O.P.S.A Project
====

<b>About:</b>
<br>
The Corning Online Privacy and Security Augmentation [COPSA] Project's goal is to write rulesets for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> browser add-on by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF]</a> for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Android OS, and Opera web browsers to better secure and privatize website traffic and content for people in the Corning, NY area or who are accessing content that is in the Corning, NY area.

<b>Why:</b><br>
<b>1.</b> Because we actually give a s*** about online security and privacy.<br>
<b>2.</b> We do NOT want to easily be tracked by organizations such as the NSA.<br>
<b>3.</b> We want to decrease the odds of our information getting stolen/used against us.<br>

Rulesets and their status:
