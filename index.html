<p><b>About:</b>
<br>
The Corning Online Privacy and Security Augmentation [COPSA] Project's goal is to write code for the sake of protecting the on-line privacy and security of the people of the Corning, NY area, and indirectly the rest of the world.</p>

<p>To dumb it down: WE MAKEZ DEMZ INTERNETZ SAFERZ FOR CORNING PEEPZ.</p>

<p><b>Why:</b><br>
<b>1.</b> Because we actually give a s*** about online security and privacy.<br>
<b>2.</b> We do NOT want to easily be tracked by organizations such as the National Security Agency.<br>
<b>3.</b> We want to decrease the odds of our information getting stolen on-line/used against us.<br></p>

<p>Currently, COPSA has two programs made:</p>

<ul>
<li>NSA Smacker</li>
<li>HTTPS Them All</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="nsa-smacker" class="anchor" href="#nsa-smacker" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>NSA Smacker</h2>

<p>NSA Smacker is a simple, procedural <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">GNU Bash</a> script that prevents a user, on a single computer level i.e. not every user on a network but only per computer that ran the script, from connecting to websites that are known for malicious content and/or helping the NSA spy on people by adding these websites to the /etc/hosts list and making the user's computer resolve them back to themselves (127.0.0.1).</p>

<p>The program is only known to work on the GNU+Linux operating system.</p>

<p>You can get NSA Smacker <a href="https://github.com/theatre-x/nsa_smacker">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="https-them-all" class="anchor" href="#https-them-all" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HTTPS Them All</h2>

<p>The goal for HTTPS Them All is to write rulesets for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> browser add-on by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF]</a>, which is available for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Android OS, and Opera web browsers, to better secure and privatize website traffic and content for people in the Corning, NY area and/or who are accessing content that is in the Corning, NY area.</p>

<p>You can get the code by clicking any of the "Download" buttons above.</p>
