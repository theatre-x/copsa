<p><b>About:</b>
<br>
The Corning Online Privacy and Security Augmentation [COPSA] Project's goal is to write rulesets for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> browser add-on by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation [EFF]</a>, which is available for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Android OS, and Opera web browsers, to better secure and privatize website traffic and content for people in the Corning, NY area and/or who are accessing content that is in the Corning, NY area.</p>

<p>We plan on writing our own Free Software security programs for non-free operating systems to protect users who have to use these operating systems from prying eyes.</p>

<p>To dumb it down: WE MAKEZ DEMZ INTERNETZ SAFERZ FOR CORNING PEEPZ.</p>

<p><b>Why:</b><br>
<b>1.</b> Because we actually give a s*** about online security and privacy.<br>
<b>2.</b> We do NOT want to easily be tracked by organizations such as the NSA.<br>
<b>3.</b> We want to decrease the odds of our information getting stolen/used against us.<br></p>

<p>You can contribute by either<br>
<br>
(In order of largest to smallest contribution)
<br>
<b>1.</b> Testing for HTTPS on websites for local institutions, business, organizations, etc and then writing a ruleset for them.<br>
<b>2.</b> Working on buggy rulesets<br>
<b>3.</b> Reporting bugs<br>
<b>4.</b> Getting local businesses, organizations, instiutions, etc to either use SSL/TLS on their websites and/or nagging them until they fix their unencrypted content or supplying their page with owner info.<br>
<b>5.</b> Spread the project and HTTPS Everywhere like wildfire.<br></p>

<a id="filefolder-structure" class="anchor" href="#filefolder-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>File/Folder Structure:</h1>

<p>The files on this page are organized according to their development status starting from barely functioning pieces of s*** to stable and working as desired.<br>
<br>
<b>Stable:</b> Means that the ruleset has been tested and evaluated thoroughly enough and we have declared it safe for use.<br>
<b>Beta:</b> The ruleset works but needs some TLC in the form of extensive evaluating, modifying, and testing before pushing it to Stable status.<br>
<b>Alpha:</b> Barely functioning piece of crap. Anything in this directory should NOT be used by ANYONE who does not know what they are doing. This is where we add in the new rulesets as well for their first phase of tests and analysis.</p>
